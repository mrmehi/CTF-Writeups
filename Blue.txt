1 ~ How many ports are open with a port number under 1000? 
PORT     STATE SERVICE
135/tcp   open  msrpc (Microsoft Windows RPC)
139/tcp   open  netbios-ssn (Network Basic Input Output System)
445/tcp   open  microsoft-ds (Used in file sharing)

    ```ANS: 3```



2 ~ What is this machine vulnerable to? (Answer in the form of: ms??-???, ex: ms08-067)
 As in the results of `nmap --script=vuln` , Remote Code Execution vulnerability in Microsoft SMBv1 servers (ms17-010)


    ```ANS: ms17-010```


3 ~ Find the exploitation code we will run against the machine. What is the full path of the code? (Ex: exploit/........)
    ```ANS: exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue```


4 ~ Convert a shell to meterpreter shell in metasploit. What is the name of the post module we will use? (Exact path, similar to the exploit we previously selected) 
    ```ANS: post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter ```


5 ~ List all of the processes running via the 'ps' command in metasploit âœ”


Additional: `Anything that uses the SMBv1 (Server Message Block version 1) file-sharing protocol is technically at risk of being targeted for ransomware and other cyberattacks.
The SMB version 1 (SMBv1) server in various versions of Microsoft Windows mishandles specially crafted packets from remote attackers, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the target computer. 
Running on port 445 (Microsoft DS which is used for file sharing)
