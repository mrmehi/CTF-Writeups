	rlwrap is a program which, in simple terms, gives us access to history, tab autocompletion and the arrow keys immediately upon receiving a shell; however, some manual stabilisation must still be utilised if you want to be able to use Ctrl + C inside the shell. rlwrap is not installed by default on Kali, so first install it with sudo apt install rlwrap.

	To use rlwrap, we invoke a slightly different listener:

	rlwrap nc -lvnp <port>

	Prepending our netcat listener with "rlwrap" gives us a much more fully featured shell. This technique is particularly useful when dealing with Windows shells, which are otherwise notoriously difficult to stabilise. When dealing with a Linux target, it's possible to completely stabilise, by using the same trick as in step three of the previous technique: background the shell with Ctrl + Z, then use stty raw -echo; fg to stabilise and re-enter the shell.

First, open another terminal and run stty -a. This will give you a large stream of output. Note down the values for "rows" and columns. Next, in your reverse/bind shell, type in

stty rows <number>

and

stty cols <number>

This will change the registered width and height of the terminal, thus allowing programs such as text editors which rely on such information being accurate to correctly open.
