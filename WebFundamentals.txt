1 ~ The server should reply with a response. The response follows a similar structure to the request, but the first line describes the status rather than a verb and a path.
The status will normally be a code, you're probably already familiar with 404: Not found.

A basic breakdown of the status codes is:

````
100-199: Information
200-299: Successes (200 OK is the "normal" response for a GET)
300-399: Redirects (the information you want is elsewhere)
400-499: Client errors (You did something wrong, like asking for something that doesn't exist)
500-599: Server errors (The server tried, but something went wrong on their side)

2 ~ What are cookies?

Cookies are small bits of data that are stored in your browser. 
Each browser will store them separately, so cookies in Chrome won't be available in Firefox. 
They have a huge number of uses, but the most common are either session management or advertising (tracking cookies). 
Cookies are normally sent with every HTTP request made to a server
