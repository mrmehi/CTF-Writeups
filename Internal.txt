4 - Since it is not a good idea to spend time on enumurating ssh, I will start with http service.


5 - Adding IP to /etc/hosts (internal.thm)

6 - Path:/ 

Default Apache Config page which does not have something odd in the source code.

7 - Path: /blog

Seemingly a wordpress website

8 - With `wpscan URL -e `, I found a possible user of "admin"

9 - Trying to brute-force the `/wp-admin` with the username "admin"

10 - Found password : "my2boys"

11 - By changing the 404.php file into reverse shell php code, we successfully get a connection back.



12 - Credentials: aubreanna:bubb13guM!@#123


13 - There is a service called "Jenkins" running locally. With ssh tunneling we can access to that service by using "ssh -L".


14 - Become root and grab root.txt
