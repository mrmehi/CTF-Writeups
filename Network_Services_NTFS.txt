2 ~ Enumurating NFS Shares

```
	sudo mount -t nfs IP:share /tmp/mount/ -nolock

	Let's break this down:

	Tag	Function
	sudo	Run as root
	mount	Execute the mount command
	-t nfs	Type of device to mount, then specifying that it's NFS
	IP:share	The IP Address of the NFS server, and the name of the share we wish to mount
	-nolock	Specifies not to use NLM locking

```


3 ~ 
`showmount -e [IP] to list the NFS shares`



INFO: 

```

	What is root_squash?
	By default, on NFS shares- Root Squashing is enabled, and prevents anyone connecting to the NFS share from having root access to the NFS volume. Remote root users are assigned a user “nfsnobody” when connected, which has the least local privileges. Not what we want. However, if this is turned off, it can allow the creation of SUID bit files, allowing a remote user root access to the connected system.
